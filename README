README for XML-SAX-Machines

WARNING: ALPHA CODE ALERT!!! Developing to this API could well be like trying
to skate on quicksand :).

XML::SAX::Machines is a collection of APIs that allow complex SAX machines
to be constructed without a huge amount of extra typing.

More documentation will be forthcoming, but here's the gist of it:

To build a pipeline of SAX processors, do something like:

    use XML::SAX::Machines qw( Pipeline );

    my $p = Pipeline(
        "My::SAX::Filter1",
        "My::SAX::Filter2",
        \$output
    );

    $p->parse_uri( $ARGV[0] );

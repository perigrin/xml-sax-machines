XML::Filter::Distributor - Multipass processing of documents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ## See XML::SAX::Manifold for an easier way to use this filter.

    use XML::SAX::Machines qw( Machine ) ;

    ## See the wondrous ASCII ART below for help visualizing this
    ## XML::SAX::Manifold makes this a lot easier.
    my $m = Machine(
        [ Intake => "XML::Filter::Distributor" => qw( V TOC Body ) ],
            [ V      => "My::Validator" ],
            [ TOC    => "My::TOCExtractor" => qw( Merger ) ],
            [ Body   => "My::BodyMasseuse" => qw( Merger ) ],
        [ Merger => "XML::Filter::Merger" => qw( Output ) ],
        [ Output => \*STDOUT ],
    );

    ## Let the distributor coordinate with the merger.
    ## XML::SAX::Manifold does this for you.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::Filter::Distributor is a SAX filter that allows "multipass" processing
of a document by sending the document through several channels of SAX
processors one channel at a time.  A channel may be a single SAX
processor or a machine like a pipeline (see L<XML::SAX::Pipeline>).

This can be used to send the source document through one entire
processing chain before beginning the next one, for instance if the
first channel is a validator or linter that throws exceptions on error.

It can also be used to run the document through multiple processing
chains and glue all of the chains' output documents back together with
something like XML::Filter::Merger.  The SYNOPSIS does both.

This differs from L<XML::Filter::SAXT> in that the channels are
prioritized and each channel receives all events for a document before
the next channel receives any events.  XML::Filter::Distributor buffers all
events while feeding them to the highest priority channel
(C<$processor1> in the synopsis), and replays them for each lower
priority channel one at a time.

The event flow for the example in the SYNOPSIS would look like, with the
numbers next to the connection arrow indicating when the document's
events flow along that arrow.

                            +-------------+
                         +->| Validator   |
                       1/   +-------------+
                       /
          1   +-------+ 2   +--------------+ 2    +--------+      
 upstream ----| Dist. |---->| TOCExtractor |--*-->| Merger |-> STDOUT
              +-------+     +--------------+ /    +--------+   
                       \3                   /3
                        \   +--------------+
                         +->| BodyMasseuse |
                            +--------------+                         |

Here's the timing of the event flows:

   1: upstream -> Dist ->  Validator
   2:             Dist -> TOCExtractorc -> Merger -> STDOUT
   3:             Dist -> BodyMassseuse -> Merger -> STDOUT

When the document arrives from upstream, the events all arrive during time
period 1 and are buffered and also passed through processor 1.  After all
events have been received (as indicated by an C<end_document> event from
upstream), all events are then played back through processor 2, and then
through processor 3.

    my $d = XML::Filter::Distributor->new(
        { Handler => $h1 },

A channel may be any SAX machine, frequently they are pipelines.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Can only feed a single aggregator at the moment :).  I can fix this with
a bit of effort.

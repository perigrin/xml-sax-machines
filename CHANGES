0.40
    - Add several state getter methods to XML::Filter::Merger to
      make subclassing easier.

0.39 Fri Sep  6 11:44:23 EDT 2002
    - Get end_document to return the next handler's end_document()
      result when not in manifold mode.

0.38 Fri Sep  6 10:05:32 EDT 2002
    - Require XML::SAX::Writer > 0.41.
    - Allow merger to be subclassed
    - Remove need to call start_/end_manifold_document() if you're
      just merging secondary documents that occur inline.

0.37 Thu Sep  5 17:35:02 EDT 2002
    - Make XML::Filter::Merger handle nested documents correctly and
      tweak XML::Filter::DocSplitter to agree.

0.36 Tue Jul 23 14:00:47 EDT 2002
    - Correct t/xsw_version.t to test for 0.41 instead of 0.39

0.35 Mon Jul 22 13:10:23 EDT 2002
    - Remove a dependency on hash order that perl5.8.0's new
      hash algorithm exposes.  THIS AFFECTS ONLY THE TEST SUITE unless
      you are checking for $@ =~ /.../ in order to catch/filter
      cycle dependancy checks.
    - Makefile.PL warn()s if XML::SAX::Writer 0.40 is detected.  It's
      too broken.  There's also a new test suite t/00xsw_version.t to
      barn again and fail.

0.34 Thu Mar 21 09:55:46 EST 2002
    - Get Merger.pm to properly deal with events before and
      after the root element events.  Reported by
      ASSAD Arnaud <arnaud@cruncher.underlands.org>

0.33 Tue Mar 19 10:59:42 EST 2002
    - Port back to perl5.00503 (reported by Kip Hampton
        - no named regexp character classes ([...[:alpha:]...])
	- can't supress "used only once, possible typo" warnings

0.32 Wed Mar  6 10:09:55 EST 2002
    - fix eval { return } thinko in X::S::Machine::parse(),
      reported by Rick Frankel <rick@rickster.com>.
    - test for $class->can( "new" ) before doing eval "require $class"
      awkward code highlighted by christian.glahn@uibk.ac.at
    - Added diagnositc errors for undef or '' filter names
    - Added t/10bad_machine.t
    - Prevent unresolvable filters from causing later, additional,
      confusing error messages.
    - Add test to make sure an "empty derived class" can be specced by
      name (this worked ok before and now; just added a test).

0.311
    - Require at least XML::SAX::Base 1.02, removed X::S::B::set_handler
      workaround.
    - Require XML::SAX 0.05, not 0.3
    - Added two more examples to MANIFEST

0.31 Tue Jan 22 12:27:55 EST 2002
    - ByRecords now counts stack depth accurately.  Tested with patched
    XML::Filter::LibXSLT.
